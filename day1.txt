Ans: An Algorithm is a step by step procedure or set of rules to perfrom
some specific task or to solve a particular problem. It consist of a
number of finite state of well defined instructions that take inputs
, proccess it, and produce some output

Q2. Write an algorithm to check given number is Perfect
number?
Step1: Start
Step2: input a number
Step3: initialize fsum=0
Step4: Loop from 1 to &lt;=n/2
If i is divisor of(n%I==0) then add i to fsum
Step5:Check if fsum is equal to original number(n)
If n==fsum then print it is Perfect Number
Else ,print this is not a perfect number
Step6: end
